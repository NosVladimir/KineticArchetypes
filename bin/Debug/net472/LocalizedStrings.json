    "enGB": "In the more martial minded parts of the world, the way of the kinetic duelist is drilled into the training regimens of any potential kineticist, wanting to train them for conflict as soon as possible. Their training often emphasizes their fondness for individual combat. The art of the kinetic duelist can also be sneaky and swift, as a warrior who can carry a blade at all times without suspicion is a valuable soldier. Kinetic duelists themselves are more prone to fighting a single opponent, and abstain from larger combat whenever possible.",
    "zhCN": "在尚武的地区，斗念之道被深深刻进了每一位潜在操念使的训练方案中，以便尽快为冲突做好准备。他们的训练往往热衷于单打独斗。作为能够随时携带武器而不引起怀疑的战士，斗念使也能展现出狡猾而迅速的武艺。斗念使本身更倾向于与单个对手战斗，并尽可能避免参与大规模的作战。"

A kinetic duelist may attack with this energy as though using the kinetic blade infusion, as well as being able to make attacks of opportunity with it.

When choosing an infusion, a kinetic duelist cannot choose form infusions that are beyond 1st level and do not list kinetic blade as a prerequisite.",
