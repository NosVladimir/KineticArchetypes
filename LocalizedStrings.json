Their training often emphasizes their fondness for individual combat. The art of the kinetic duelist can also be sneaky and swift, as a warrior who can carry a blade at all times without suspicion is a valuable soldier. Kinetic duelists themselves are more prone to fighting a single opponent, and abstain from larger combat whenever possible.",
    "zhCN": "在尚武的地区，斗念之道被深深刻进了每一位潜在操念使的训练方案中，以便尽快为冲突做好准备。他们的训练往往热衷于单打独斗。作为能够随时携带武器而不引起怀疑的战士，斗念使也能展现出狡猾而迅速的武艺。斗念使本身更倾向于与单个对手战斗，并尽可能避免参与大规模的作战。"
