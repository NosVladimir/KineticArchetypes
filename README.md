### [Kinetic Duelist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/kinetic-duelist/) (WIP)

A kineticist archetype that allows legit two-weapon fighting with kinetic blades. Heavily homebrewed since gaining dual blades at 17th level is not very appealing.
- Cannot choose form infusions that are beyond 1st level and do not list kinetic blade as a prerequisite (so no ranged form infusions apart from very basic ones)
- No infusions at 3rd and 9th levels
- No metakinesis quicken
- Bonus kinetic blade infusion at 1st level that costs 0 burn
- Kinetic dual blades activatable ability at 3rd level that allows for creating a second kinetic blade in off hand by increasing the burn of kinetic blade by 1
- One more attack with the off-hand blade at 9th level with BAB-5, another one at 15th level with BAB-10
- Recovers 1 burn if scored at least 1 hit in a full-round attack using kinetic blade(s) from 11th level
- Kinetic assault special charge that costs 3 burn, attacking with both blades and auto maximise and increase infusion DC by 2

## Planned contents
### [Cinder Adept](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/paizo-llc-kineticist-archetypes/cinder-adept-kineticist-archetype/)
Fire-only kineticist with a horse.

### Homebrew fighter archetype using kinetic blades
(Rough idea) A fighter archetype that trades some bonus feats for elemental focus and kinetic blades, trades weapon training for special weapon training for kinetic blades, and trades advanced weapon training for maybe kinetic dual blades. Maybe also trades armor training with something but I feel like that would be too much and won't make a huge distinction from a kinetic duelist.

### [Kinetic Lancer](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/kinetic-lancer/)
Using kinetic lance instead of blade, leaping (essentially teleporting) around the battlefield to full-attack foes.

## Technically challenging planned contents
### [Elemental Annihilator](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/paizo-llc-kineticist-archetypes/elemental-annihilator-kineticist-archetype/)
Features Devastating Infusion that can full-round attack foes at 120 feet, but only deals a fixed 1d8+ConModifier dmg. Trades all wild talents for extra combat feats. Has a very powerful capstone at 20th level that's a composite infusion at 4 burn dealing 5*(10d6+10) bludgeoning+cold+electricity+fire+force dmg. I suppose it can also be used together with form infusions.

### [Elemental Ascetic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/elemental-ascetic/)
Kinetic fists and flurry. DarkCodex seems to have implemented this archetype already, but it cannot be seen in-game.

### [Onslaught Blaster](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/onslaught-blaster/)
Convert every single dice increase of kinetic blasts into an additional blast fired. Maybe also works with AOE form infusions but it will be a disaster to my pc.

### [Dread Soul](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/dread-soul/)
Evil only. Forces others to take burn. Drains creatures souls to create soulstones.

### [Nihilicist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/nihilicist/)
Null element - empty blast and zero blast, dealing direct non-lethal damage. Can convert into lethal damage with a standard action, plus some conditions to the target.
